Alright. Same treatment as before.
I’ll rewrite this README so it is:

* **Industry-oriented learning journey**
* **No course/platform names**
* **Week structure exactly matches the image**
* Professional, not academic fluff

Below is the **clean rewritten README**. Replace your existing one with this.

# Data Science & Big Data

This repository documents my **learning journey in data science and big data**, with a focus on skills that are directly relevant to **industry, analytics roles, and large-scale data systems**.

The purpose of this repository is to build **strong foundations in data science concepts and big data technologies**, supported by hands-on practice, structured notes, and practical implementations rather than surface-level theory.

---

## 📌 What This Repository Covers

This repository follows a progressive path from core data science concepts to large-scale data processing and analytics, including:

* Foundations of data science and analytical thinking
* Probability and statistics for data-driven decision making
* Data preparation, cleaning, and transformation
* Data visualization and interpretation
* Big data architectures and distributed systems
* MapReduce programming model
* Big data tools and processing frameworks
* NoSQL databases
* Mining large-scale and streaming data
* Link analysis and network-based analysis
* Web and social network analysis
* Data analysis and visualization using R
* Advanced analytical techniques using R

All content is organized **week-wise**, reflecting a clear progression from fundamentals to advanced analytics.
