# Data Science & Big Data

This repository contains my **week-by-week coursework, hands-on practice, and implementations** based on the **SWAYAM Data Science and Big Data** curriculum.

The goal of this repository is to build **strong fundamentals in data science and big data systems**, supported by clean code, structured notes, and practical examples rather than superficial theory.

---

## 📌 Course Overview

The course covers the complete pipeline of data science and big data analytics, including:

- Data science fundamentals
- Probability and statistics
- Data preparation and visualization
- Big data architectures
- MapReduce programming
- NoSQL databases
- Data mining and stream processing
- Web and social network analysis
- R programming for analytics

All content in this repository is organized **week-wise** following the official course layout.
